## About Application:
This application is my portfolio.  It is a work in progress as I learn more about full stack coding I make updates to it.  I display my hardwork I have done thus far in my portfolio.


## User Story


For this project, we are asked to create the beginning layout of our portfolio.
In my portfolio, I am asked to create a page where potential employers can view my work, learn alittle about me and contact me in various ways.



## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
